In this study, bacteria were cultured from internal homogenates and external surfaces of Stomoxys flies captured from a dairy farm in Wisconsin. Sample pool information is as follows:


D01A to D08A: Internal homogenate of flies caught near free-stall barn in July <br />
D09A to D16A: Internal homogenate of flies caught near free-stall barn in August/September <br />
T01A to T08A: External homogenate of flies caught near free-stall barn in July <br />
T09A to T16A: External homogenate of flies caught near free-stall barn in August/September <br />
D01C to D04C: Internal homogenate of flies caught near calf-hutches in July <br />
D05C to D07C: Internal homogenate of flies caught near calf-hutches in August/September <br />
T01C to T04C: External homogenate of flies caught near calf-hutches in July <br />
T05C to T07C: External homogenate of flies caught near calf-hutches in August/September <br />

Files in this repository:

*ArlingtonPathogenIncidence_DataSummary.xlsx* -> Excel file containing a summary of all bacterial isolates cultured from stable flies. The "Strains" tab provides information on the sample type, isolation media, partial 16S rRNA sequence, and taxonomic information. Remaining sheets provide a summary of incidence rates in different sample types for key bacterial taxa. <br />
*FisherTests -> R Script for fisher tests* <br />
*Table_RImport.xlsx* -> Required input file showing the counts of key taxa in different sample types for R Script. The "total" column represents the number of fly pools for each sample type <br />
